    Turn uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) keys to allow access to the API. Before making any requests to the API you must request a token. Please request a token by contacting your sales representative.
    # 
    All API requests to the Turn API must include the JWT in an Authorization header. The format of the header is described below:


        Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

    Where *Authorization* is the header name, and *Bearer jwt_token* is the header value.

    > You must replace jwt token with your personal API key.
