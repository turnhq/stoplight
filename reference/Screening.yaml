    Welcome to the Turn API. Our API is designed to make it easy for you to automate the initialization and management, of all your screening needs. Our API is a modern REST API and can easily be consumed with any programming language.

    ## Authentication

    Turn uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) keys to allow access to the API. Before making any requests to the API you must request a token. Please request a token by contacting your sales representative.
    # 
    All API requests to the Turn API must include the JWT in an Authorization header. The format of the header is described below:


        Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

    Where *Authorization* is the header name, and *Bearer jwt_token* is the header value.

    > You must replace jwt token with your personal API key.

      summary: Invite
      description: "The Asynchronous Person Search endpoint is the most basic way to initiate a background check. It's a two way process:\n\n1. This endpoint is called with the necesary details to invite a candidate to do a background check.\n\n2. When the background check is completed, the results will be posted back to your provided URL. \n\nRather than returning an inline response, requests made to this endpoint will return a unique UUID as a response. The full person response will then be returned asynchronously via HTTP POST to an endpoint that is specified as an additional callback_url parameter in the original requrest.\n\nThe UUID will be included as an additional key:value pair in the response, in order to tie requests back to their responses.\n\n|Parameter\t\t\t|Required\t|Type\t\t\t|Description\n|:-----------\t\t|---------  |------\t\t\t|-----------\n|first_name\t\t\t|true\t\t|`string`\t\t|Legal first name of the person to check\n|last_name\t\t\t|true\t\t|`string`\t\t|Legal last name of the person to check\n|email\t\t\t\t|true\t\t|`string`\t\t|The email of the person to check\n|phone_number\t\t|false\t\t|`string`\t\t|Mobile phone number of the person to check\n|email_candidate\t|false\t(defaults to `true`)|`boolean`\t|Boolean value to indicate whether Turn should initiate the invitation via email (and via sms if a phone number was provided)\n|callback_url\t\t|true\t\t|`string`\t\t|A URL endpoint to which the background results will be POSTed asynchronously\n|reference_id\t\t|false\t\t|`string`\t\t|An arbitrary metadata value that can be passed. It will be returned in the response and also visible on the background report in your Turn Dashboard\n|package_id\t\t\t|false\t\t|`string`\t\t|The id of the package this check will use\n|redirect_url\t\t|false\t\t|`string` \t\t|After completion of the background check flow, the candidate will be redirected to the provided URL\n|do_checks\t\t|false\t(defaults to `true`)|`boolean` \t\t|If true starts the background check right away after the candidate consents, if false puts the check in a standby mode to be started at a later date using the `worker_id` provided in the response.\n\n\n\n## About *email_candidate*\nIf you want Turn to initiate the communication with the candidate to start the background check, specify this flag in `true`. Marking this flag as `false` means you want to control the communication with your candidate. Use the `candidate_consent_url` response parameter to show your candidate the personalized consent form to start the background check, you can send this link using an internal communication channel (email, slack, etc) or embed the link inside a web application of your own or even a mobile app.\n\n## About *do_checks*\nIf *do_checks* is specified as `false` the background check won't be started right away after the candidate consents. The check will be in an _initiated_ status which means:\n\n* The check won't appear in your Turn Dashboard (until it's requested)\n* You won't be charged for this check if it's never initiated\n* The candidate won't be notified/sent any communication\n\nIf not specified, do_checks will always be `true`\n\nTo request the execution of the background check the /person/\\<worker_id\\>/run endpoint.\n\n\n## About *phone_number*\nIf a phone number is specified and `email_candidate` is set to `true`, we'll also send a TEXT invitation (alongside the email). We'll send reminders as well, if we detect that the background check hasn't been started. \n\n## About *package_id*\nIf you are configured with multiple packages, you can pass in the ID of the package here. The package_id is an 11 character string starting with a ‘P’ and followed by 10 digits. If no package_id is passed, the configured default package will be used.\n\n## Consent Form Prepopulation\nfirst_name, last_name, email and phone_number will be used to prepopulate the candidate_consent_url the candidate will receive to start the background check form."

                    copy_html: '<p><span>Para informaci&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol, visite <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a> o escribe a la Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</span></p> <p><span><strong>A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</strong></span></p> <p><span>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. <strong>For more information, including information about additional rights, go to </strong><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span><strong>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</strong></span></a><strong> or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</strong></span></p> <p><span><strong>You must be told if information in your file has been used against you.</strong> Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You have the right to know what is in your file.</strong> You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your &ldquo;file disclosure&rdquo;). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if: - a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report; - you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file; - your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud; - you are on public assistance; - you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a> for additional information.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You have the right to ask for a credit score.</strong> Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.</strong> If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a> for an explanation of dispute procedures.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.</strong> Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information.</strong> In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Access to your file is limited.</strong> A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need &ndash; usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.</strong> A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You may limit &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report.</strong> Unsolicited &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).</span></p> <p><span><strong>You may seek damages from violators.</strong> If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights.</strong> For more information, visit <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>.</span></p> <p><span><strong>States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General.

This can help us expedite MVR checks requested in Pennsylvania. This data is sent over to Pennsylvania DMV as is.\n\n## About *do_checks*\n\nIf *do_checks* is specified as `false` the background check won't be started right away. The check will be in an _initiated_ status which means:\n\n* The check won't appear in your Turn Dashboard (until it's initiated)\n* You won't be charged for this check if it's never initiated\n* The candidate won't be notified/sent any communication\n\nIf not specified, do_checks will always be `true`\n\n## About *reference_id*\n\nIf *reference_id* is provided, the background check will be tagged with that specific reference. This could be any arbitrary text reference, it can be used to identify any particular background check with an internal id or candidate. If a background check is tagged with a *reference_id* it will be displayed in the Turn Dashboard, it will be included in all webhook communications and invoicing.\n\n## About *timestamps* and *metadata*\n\nA strong consent process requires information about how and when a candidate provided consent to be screened. \n\n### timestamps\n\nA series of disclosures are presented in the the first call to POST /fcra_check/form. Every disclosure is a section that the candidate should consent to. Each section has a key (welcome, summary_of_rights..) and these same keys should be provided in the timestamps section along with the corresponding time of each event.\n\nThe timestamps provided should be UTC ISO-8601 and they reflect the time the candidate accepted each section of the disclosures.\n\n### metadata\n\nMetadata states information about the device and location of where the consent was required.\n\n* ip_address - Should be the one of the applicant consenting to the background check.\n* user_agent - Should be any string that identifies the browser user agent or the mobile application version.\n\n## About *consent_document*\n\nA base64 encoded representation of the applicant's signature must be embedded inline in the payload that is sent to us. We expect this to be a text composed of 2 parts:\n\n1. The prefix `data:image/png;base64,`\n2. The encoded image data itself.\n\nWe recommend that images do not exceed 8MB.\n\nImages must be PNG files.\n\nIn case the provided signature is not valid, a 422 status code will be returned, along with the error message.\n\nExample: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVQYV2NgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=`\n\n## About *drivers_license_image(s)*\n\nTurn supports the optional submission of both front and back images of a driver's license (via the `drivers_license_image_front` and `drivers_license_image_back` parameters). While not mandatory, providing these images can expedite the background check process and enhance the accuracy of the report.\n\nThe image should be provided as a base64-encoded string:\n\n1. The prefix `data:image/[MIMETYPE];base64,`\n2. The encoded image data itself.\n\n- Supported MIME types: jpeg, png, gif, bmp, heic, heif, webp and tiff\n- We recommend that images do not exceed 8MB\n\nExample: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVQYV2NgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=`\n"

        The provided worker id can be any of:

        3. Your provided reference_id

        ## 422 Background Check not ready

        If you request the background check of a candidate that hasn't provided the initial consent, an 422 http estatus will be issued along with a detailed message. No information is available at this point since the candidate hasn't provided the initial input to start the background check.

        ## About Background Check completion

        If you request the details of any processing-bacground check a `warning` message will be included in the response, stating that no action should be taken against this candidate, for it's report is still being processed and any infractions you see in the report are not final. You can also look for the `complete` flag that will always be delivered in the same response, if `true` the background check is already done, and ready for you to take action if needed, if `false` the background check is still being processed.

        # Introduction

        When this endpoint is called, it will immediatly kick off a recheck for the specified already existing background check. A Recheck runs a complete re-execution of a previously completed Background Check, to get updated results, without needing an applicant to go over the complete consent process all over again.

        When a Recheck is requested, Turn holds everything together under the same Turn ID. The Background Check is put back in the `processing` status, and afterwards it flows naturally as any other Background Check does, and webhooks are sent for subsequent status updates.


        # Preconditions

        ## Background Check Status 
        The specified background check must be in one of the following status: 
        - Approved
        - Consider
        - Rejected

        # About Turn ID

        A recheck can be requested specifying a Turn Id (as received in all Background Check API requests), a Worker ID as received in API Levels 1 and 2, or if a `reference_id` was provided to tag the Background Check request, then that `reference_id` can be used to start a recheck.

        Note: If using the `reference_id` approach, and more than one Background Check has ben tagged with the same reference, then the most recent discovered Background Check will be targeted.

        ## IDs accepted to start a Recheck
        1. The full UUID of the worker eg: `d54eb469-d74d-450a-b7f9-b0d98f55ac9e`
        2. The shortened version, also called turn id: `C1704355400`
        3. Your provided reference_id, eg: `abc-123-internal`


        # Identifying when a Background Check is Rechecked

        To correctly identify the origin of a Background Check, either it being the original request, or a recheck, webhooks and query endpoints make available the `consent_date` and the `recheck_date` of any Background Check.

        - `consent_date` - Is the original date, the Background Check was requested.
        - `recheck_date` - Is the last date, the Background Check was rechecked.

        Both data points are available in [Status Update Webooks](/docs/turn-api/9b22ed33bf5d2-screening#a-candidate-status-update), and both [Status](/docs/turn-api/77681a1739f13-person-worker-id-status) and [Details](/docs/turn-api/1a0557277b86a-person-worker-id-details) query endpoints.

            copy_html: '<p><span>Para informaci&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol, visite <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a> o escribe a la Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</span></p> <p><span><strong>A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</strong></span></p> <p><span>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. <strong>For more information, including information about additional rights, go to </strong><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span><strong>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</strong></span></a><strong> or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</strong></span></p> <p><span><strong>You must be told if information in your file has been used against you.</strong> Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You have the right to know what is in your file.</strong> You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your &ldquo;file disclosure&rdquo;). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if: - a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report; - you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file; - your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud; - you are on public assistance; - you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a> for additional information.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You have the right to ask for a credit score.</strong> Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.</strong> If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a> for an explanation of dispute procedures.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.</strong> Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information.</strong> In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Access to your file is limited.</strong> A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need &ndash; usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.</strong> A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>.</span></p> <p><span><strong>You may limit &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report.</strong> Unsolicited &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).</span></p> <p><span><strong>You may seek damages from violators.</strong> If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights.</strong> For more information, visit <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>.</span></p> <p><span><strong>States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General.

      Recheck enables you to re-run the background check for any specific worker. Worker's consent won't be required again, so the background check will be initiated right away.


      Conditions:
      The worker should already have a completed background check (Approved, Consider or Rejected).
