# Workforce
Turn centralizes data on each worker to define a unique job profile consisting of identity and performance data. Partners provide this information to Turn through the Workforce API.

## About *turn_id*
The turn_id is the unique id provided by Turn through the screening of a candidate. This unique id is an 11 character string starting with a ‘C’ and followed by 10 digits (ex. C1279030625). The Turn ID is required to be specified in the URL indicated as <turn_id> in the documentation. If the Turn ID is not included, the information will not be correctly shared.

## About record *id*
Some records posted have a unique id. These unique ids are the identifiers generated by your system and do not need to follow a specified format. They can be sequential numbers or an alphanumeric UUID system.
