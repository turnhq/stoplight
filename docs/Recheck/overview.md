# Recheck

The Recheck feature is an on-demand tool available in the Actions menu of the background check report on the Screen Dashboard and also through integration.

Recheck allows the request of a brand new background check on an already screened worker. Worker's consent won't be required again, so the background check will be initiated right away. The background check will be found under the same Turn ID and the new reports will be sent to the requester and the worker.

Conditions: The worker should already have a completed background check (Approved, Consider or Rejected).

# CA Recheck

Recheck in California works different because this state requires a new consent every time a background check is requested on a worker, regardless of them having a completed background check.

CA Recheck works based on the zip code entered by the worker on their original background check. This will trigger a protocol that will send communications to the worker via email and SMS to submit their consent and have a recheck conducted under the same Turn ID.
