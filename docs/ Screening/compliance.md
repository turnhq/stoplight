## Submitting an Application for Background Checks
Candidates must follow the following steps to submit an application for background checks:

1.  Provide general information, i.e. full legal name, date of birth, Social Security Number (SSN), etc.
2.  Read and confirm the understanding of the Summary of Candidate’s Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
3.  Read and confirm the understanding of the Disclosure Regarding Background Investigation.
4.  Read and confirm the understanding of the Summary of Candidate’s State’s Rights (if applicable).
5.  Provide the Authorization to perform a Background Check.
6.  Certify that all the provided information is true, valid, accurate, and complete.

## Approving an Applicant
Approved is the default status if the applicants submitted information matches public records and the background check report does not have any “hits.” If the report does return with a hit, the employer may still determine the candidate passes company guidelines and approve the candidate via their dashboard.

## Review Status
Review status occurs when inaccurate information submitted by the candidate prevents Turn from properly identifying the candidate in public records or you have enabled the Adjudication Matrix.

## Reviewing Status Because Information Entered is Incorrect
In the first case, when a new background check is initiated, the SSN Trace is the process performed prior to any other checks. If a discrepancy occurs at this point, candidates’ profiles will be placed in “Reviewing” status while the Compliance Team reaches out directly to the candidate to obtain the required information. Therefore, Turn cannot with full confidence kickoff the remaining checks (i.e. MVR, criminal searches, etc.). However, the employer does have the ability to override this stage and “Resume Checks” if you’re comfortable with the mismatched or invalid information provided by the candidate, thereby relieving Turn of all resulting responsibility and requesting Turn proceed with the remaining checks using the information provided by the candidate.

## Reviewing Status Because the Adjudication Matrix Option is Enabled
In the second case, if the Adjudication Matrix option is enabled, your company has previously provided us with a matrix defining what potential “hits” you are and are not willing to accept. The candidate’s status will be placed into Reviewing while the Compliance Team applies your guidelines to the results of the candidate’s background check. If the Compliance Team determines that the candidate passes your company’s guidelines, we will change the candidate’s background to Approved. Conversely, if the Team determines that the candidate’s results are outside your Adjudication Matrix, the Adverse Action process will be initiated. And as a result, the candidate’s status may change to Rejected.

## Withdrawn
Withdrawn is a status applied when you are no longer interested in an applicant, Turn is unable to verify an applicant’s identity, or the candidate indicates they are no longer interested in proceeding. Withdrawn is similar to an “Archived” status, but is meant to be a final state where no action further action will be taken.

## Adverse Action
The FCRA requires a certain sequence of steps be taken when the employer who requested the background check report, based on information from the report, takes any action with a negative impact on an applicant’s employment. This could mean refusing to hire, engage, or contract with a candidate based on information from background checks. Or this could mean firing a worker based on the same. Failure to follow the required process could expose the employer to potential litigation. The first step of this process is the Pre-Adverse Action notification. This step provides candidates with an opportunity to dispute the information from their background checks. If no dispute is received, the industry practice is to wait five business days before sending the final Adverse Action letter.

## Dispute Process
The FCRA provides applicants with the right to dispute information contained in their background check report. If information is disputed, the FCRA mandates that Turn conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the report if it is unverifiable.

Reinvestigation scenarios:

1.  **When an applicant is disputing the information contained in the background check report**a Compliance Agent will reinvestigate the information and remove records if the information is unverifiable. The Compliance Agent will notify the employer’s Adverse Action contact if there are any updates made to the applicant’s background check report.
2.  **When an applicant is disputing a specific offense or offenses listed in the report as inaccurate**(e.g. inaccurate disposition of a criminal charge), a Compliance Agent will reinvestigate the disposition and record findings or update the report accordingly.
3.  **When an applicant is providing supporting official documentation**the Compliance Agent will reinvestigate and update the applicant’s report or file accordingly, always notifying the employer’s Adverse Action contact.
4.  **When an applicant wants to discuss mitigating factors**the Compliance Agent will direct the candidate to follow-up with the employer’s AA contact.**(NOTE: Turn will NOT need to follow-up with the employer.)**

## Legal Guidance
The process above was created in conjunction with Seyfarth Shaw LLP, the industry’s leading compliance, privacy, and FCRA lawyers, to create a streamlined flow. Turn’s unique compliance flow requires the applicant to confirm the accuracy and completeness of a report before any adverse decision can be made, thereby drastically reducing the likelihood of disputes or potential litigation exposure. Internally, Turn employs its own in-house legal and compliance team to stay ahead of issues related to FCRA employment and consumer privacy.
