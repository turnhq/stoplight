# Background-Checks

Background checks are an easy and secure way to screen and confirm candidates are qualified to provide a service. Turn can run a basic background check in 1.1 seconds with industry-leading turnaround times.

Below is the list of checks Turn can run:

## Identity Verification
Are your candidates who they claim to be? Identity verification lets you discover possible identity theft or impersonation. This check will validate an SSN, the first step in this process is the SSN Trace, which seeks to match the SSN provided by the applicant with the records from the Social Security Administration, compare the results with public record databases, look for matches against the name, date of birth, and address history, and cross-check against the SSN Death Master File (to confirm the candidate is not using a deceased SSN).

Average TAT: Instant.

All possible result statuses for an SSN Trace are described in the following table:

|Status|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Valid|The SSN has been issued by the US Social Security Administration (SSA)|
|Invalid|This SSN has not been issued by the SSA. This may be an error by the candidate, but a candidate with an Invalid SSN should not be approved.|
|Randomized|This SSN is subject to the SSN Randomization program instituted in June 2011. https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html|

## National Criminal Check
A National Criminal Search is a high-speed multi-jurisdictional search across several proprietary databases compiled from multiple sources consisting of court records, incarceration records, prison/inmate records, probation/parole/release information, arrest data, wants and warrants and/or other proprietary sources. It helps identify jurisdictions on a broader scale where a person may have a criminal record. This check is strongly advised alongside a Contingent County Search for a more thorough investigation of criminal charges on a specific candidate.

Average TAT: Instant.

## Sex Offender Search
A Sex Offender Search provides a 50-state, real-time sex offender registry scan to conifrm a candidate has never committed any sexual offense. 

Average TAT: Instant.

## Watchlist Search
Our Global Watchlist Search scans over 100 domestic and international lists to look for candidate name matches or for potential affiliations to:
- Foreign terrorist organizations
- Global terrorists on the terrorist watch list
- International narcotics traffickers
- Individuals and organizations that have been placed on watch status by U.S. and international government agencies
- OFAC
- Interpol
- And much more!

 
Average TAT: Instant.

## County Criminal Search
County criminal searches are the backbone of any background check; these are the most precise way to know the criminal history of a candidate.  A county search allows an employer to supplement with a direct search at specific courts.  Based on a candidate's social security number, we run a name and address history search behind the scenes and identify the appropriate county, state, and federal jurisdictions that apply based on the last seven years of a candidate’s address history. Most felony and misdemeanor cases are filed in county courts, so county criminal record searches are one of the most accurate sources for uncovering criminal records.  Of the 3,142 counties, approximately 50% are digitally enabling us to capture records in near real-time. For the remaining counties, we have court runners stationed to provide fast turnaround times that exceed all industry benchmarks.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Contingent | Runs a county criminal search for any record that appears in the National Criminal Search. |
| Last County | Runs a county criminal search in the last known county based on the candidate’s address history. |
| Seven Years | Runs a county criminal search in all the counties where the candidate has lived in the past seven years based on the candidate’s address history. |
| Ten Years | Runs a county criminal search in all the counties where the candidate has lived in the past ten years based on the candidate’s address history. |

Average TAT: Minutes to days depending on the County. Our median turnaround time is 19 hours for county-level searches.

## Federal Criminal Search
Federal crimes are distinct in nature - crimes reported in a federal criminal record search include only those offenses that are federally prosecuted (violations of federal law as enforced by the FBI, DEA, ATF) as opposed to local and state law. Some examples of federal crimes are mail fraud, kidnapping, bank robbery, credit card fraud, identity theft, tax evasion, and counterfeiting.  Federal criminal records are not available at the county or state level.

Average TAT: 1-2 days.

## MVR
A motor vehicle record search reviews a candidate’s driving history, the validity of the driver’s license, the up to date license plate, and any associated violations or accidents.

Average TAT: Instant (Except for PA and PR - both of which can take as long as 1 week).

## Education Verification
Confirms and validates the education history of a candidate. 

Average TAT: 1-3 days.

## Financial History
A check to look for any bankruptcies, liens, and/or judgments filed against a candidate at the federal, state, and local levels.

Average TAT: Instant.

## Employment Verification
Confirms and validates the previous employment history of a candidate.

Average TAT: 1-3 days.

## Civil Search
The civil records check will uncover any civil (non-criminal) records in the higher and lower courts at the county level for an individual, such as violations of contract agreements, evictions, or personal injury disputes.

Average TAT: Up to 2 weeks. 

## Drug Test
Technical analysis of a biological specimen (urine is the most common), to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their metabolites.

Average TAT: 1-3 days.
