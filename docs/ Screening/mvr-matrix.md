# MVR Matrix (Autoapprove)
You can set up a MVR matrix to auto-approve candidates based on rules you set forth on the number of violations and accidents.

We will create a template based on your MVR rules:

| **Moving Violations** | **No Accidents***(at-fault) | **One Accident***(at-fault) | **Two Accidents***(at-fault) | **Three or More Accidents*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Zero**(0) | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable | **Un**acceptable (borderline) |
| **One**(1) | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable (borderline) | **Un**acceptable (borderline) |
| **Two**(2) | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable (borderline) | **Unacceptable** |
| **Three**(3) | Acceptable | Acceptable (borderline) | **Un**acceptable (borderline) | **Unacceptable** |
| **Four**(4) | Acceptable (borderline) | **Un**acceptable (borderline) | **Unacceptable** | **Unacceptable** |
| **Five**(5) or any**‘Major’**** | **Un**acceptable (borderline) | **Unacceptable** | **Unacceptable** | **Unacceptable** |
