#  Common Background Check flows
A background check consists of 3 phases: gathering, processing and reviewing.

**Gathering** The candidate provides all the information required and consents to be background screened.

**Processing** The time required to complete all the selected checks in the package designed by an employer. We can run a basic background check in 1.1 seconds, but complete turnaround times are dependent on both the type of package selected and the nuances of a candidate’s history. County checks tend to be the most time consuming. We have a dedicated internal compliance team to ensure processing times are always kept at a minimum.

**Reviewing** Once a background check is complete, the results fall into two categories: 1) The results come back as clear or 2) the results need to be reviewed due to a hit or data discrepancy and normally involve work between our compliance team and the candidate.

## The Candidate Experience
We create a streamlined experience to get candidates through the funnel as quickly as possible.

1.  Designed our own proprietary communication protocol that combines email and SMS outreach to get an application started.
2.  Prepopulate candidate’s information in the background check form to streamline data input.
3.  Utilize a smart form and display a series of disclosures depending on the candidate’s state residency.
4.  Candidate’s provide consent.
5.  Background check is performed.

If a candidate’s check comes back clear, we will send them a copy of the report for their records. They then continue on in an employer’s onboarding funnel.

If their background check reveals a criminal hit, we let them know about the record found and provide them an opportunity to dispute the claim. Once the report is assented
