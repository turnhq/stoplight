# What is Sourcing?
You can now source and screen candidates in one dashboard. This allows you to spend more time building and scaling your business, rather than sucking up your resources and budget with staffing agencies or advertising.

Itâ€™s easy and fast! With Sourcing, you can quickly filter and invite workers to apply to your job opportunities. Then, sit back and relax while the Turn Platform builds a pool of applicants for you within hours.

When workers apply to your job openings using Sourcing, your applicants are injected directly into your ATS, passed through a Webhook API. This makes your hiring process more efficient and expedites the onboarding process for the applicants.
