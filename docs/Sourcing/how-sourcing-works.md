# How Sourcing Works
Once your [applicant workflow is set up](#Set-Up--Integrations), Sourcing allows you to recruit qualified workers to apply to your job openings based on your company’s unique hiring needs. 

You have the option to [filter](#Target-Workers) potential applicants by age, zip code, experience, and available transportation methods. This ensures you receive applicants that are more likely to get hired, saving your team time.

To filter workers and invite them to apply to your open job, navigate to the **Sourcing tab**, then the **Find Applicants** tab in your [Turn Dashboard](https://partners.turning.io/). Here you’ll see an easy 3-step process to recruit workers:

1.  [Filter workers](#Target-Workers) based on the skills you need
2.  Tell us [how many applicants](#Enter-Desired-Number-of-Applicants) you want 
3.  [Customize a job invite](#Invite-Workers-to-Apply) that will be sent to workers, so they understand who you are and why it’s a can’t-miss job opportunity

Within hours of posting your job invite, the Sourcing platform will start generating applicants for you. These applicants will be added to your preferred tracking system via our [API](#Webhook-API) or [ATS integration](#API-or-ATS-Integration), as well as your [Turn Dashboard](https://partners.turning.io/).
