# Common Sourcing Flows
When you sign up to start recruiting qualified workers using Sourcing, we’ll work with you to complete your configuration first. We recommend using our Webhook API or ATS integration options to create the most seamless worker application experience. Additionally, workers that apply to your opportunity will be immediately injected into your hiring funnel.

## API or ATS Integration
This is the most used Sourcing configuration because Turn is automatically injecting workers, and their profile attributes, right into your hiring funnel. The worker can apply to your job opening in a single click.
