# Track Your Applicants
After you invite workers to apply to your open job, you can [view applicants](#view-applicant-list) in your [Turn Dashboard](https://partners.turning.io/). If you are set up with our ATS integration or Webhook API, you can also view Turn Applicants in your preferred tracking system.

In addition to just viewing your applicants in your Turn Dashboard, you can:

1.  Explore their [profiles](#view-applicant-profiles)
2.  [Filter or search](#filter-applicants) for specific applicants
3.  [Export](#export-applicants) them as a .csv file

**Tip:** The faster you invite an applicant to complete a background check after they apply, the more likely they are to start working!

## View Applicant List
To see a full list of your Turn Applicants, navigate to the **Sourcing tab** from the left hand navigation bar in your [Turn Dashboard](https://partners.turning.io/).

Each applicant listing displays the applicant’s:

* Full Name
* Location
* Date Applied

## Filter Applicants
Looking for a single applicant, or a group of applicants that recently applied? Simply filter your applicant list.

You can do this by:

* Searching by their name, Turn ID number, a keyword, or location
* Filtering by the date they applied

Remember, the faster you review an application and request a background check—the more likely they are to start working.

## View Applicant Profiles
You can also view more details for each applicant in their Applicant Profile. See an individual applicant’s profile by finding them in your list of applicants. Then, simply click the **eye icon** on their individual listing result.

This will open their profile with additional information, including:

* Phone Number
* Email Address

We’re working on expanding on the details provided in our applicant profiles, so be on the lookout for more information soon!

## Export Applicants
[Sourcing](/docs/turn-api/ZG9jOjE1NzEzNjk2-what-is-sourcing) also gives you the ability to export your applicants in a .csv file at any time, giving your team the flexibility to track your applicants in any way you need.

To export your applicants, simply make sure you are viewing the list of applicants on the **Sourcing tab** in your [Turn Dashboard](https://partners.turning.io/).  Click on the **Actions button** in the upper left corner of the page. Select the option to **Export** your applicants.

This will download as a .csv file with details of each applicant. For each applicant, you will see the below information in the .csv export:

* Applied Date
* First Name
* Middle Name
* Last Name
* Email Address
* Date of Birth
* Location
