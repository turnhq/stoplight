# Security
The core of Turn’s business is our data. The ability to execute on our vision and build a successful company is predicated on the trust, safety, and security of our system’s underlying data.

Our platform uses best in class security practices to monitor and block all suspicious activity while transiting data via HTTPS in real-time. Furthermore, all traffic is exchanged over SSL to ensure secure links between Turn servers and final user endpoints. Our automated monitoring looks to find and block any suspicious IP or domain coming from remote places.

Below is a review of some of the core functionality that our real-time security system provides.

**Full security visibility in real-time -**Monitors, troubleshoots, and optimizes application security using network and in-app security signals.

**Intrusion Detection -**Detects attacks on our app, or API by detecting: attackers, Tor usage, suspicious logins, known malicious IPs or users, and geo-location anomalies.

**User Protection -**Prevents data leakage by detecting account takeovers or brute force attempts. We are able to flag simultaneous connections, shared accounts, and/or unusual activities.

**Security Prioritization -**Assigns severity levels to all security anomalies to ensure we are tackling the biggest vulnerabilities first.

**Attack blocking in real-time -**Blocks attacks ranging from OWASP Top 10, account takeovers, brute force attacks, bad bots, and more in real-time.

**Proactive Security Patching -**Identifies at-risk libraries based on ever-changing vulnerable dependencies detected on our platform.

**Vulnerability Remediation -**Fixes vulnerabilities using stack traces and payload attacks, thus improving the security of our app.

**SOC2 and GDPR Compliance -**Our Infrastructure is compliant with SOC2, PCI, GDPR, OWASP top 10, and more.

**Content Security Policies -**Ensures that all the images, data, and documents visualized on our website are trusted across all of our platforms.

**Machine Learning -**Leverages machine learning to recognize fraud, identity anomalies, or other malicious attacks. These insights allow Turn to maintain an internal blacklist to exclude bad actors from potential candidates.
