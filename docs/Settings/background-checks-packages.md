# Background Check Packages
Background checks are an easy and secure way to screen and confirm candidates are qualified to provide a service.

To view the background check packages set up in your [Turn Dashboard](https://partners.turning.io/), simply navigate to **Settings, and then Packages**. Here, you can also copy links to the consent form for your available background check types. These links can be shared with any candidates you'd like to invite to complete a background check.
